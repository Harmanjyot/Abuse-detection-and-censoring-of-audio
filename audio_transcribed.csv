You hit me with that glass, I'll sue you. I'm recording right now. Awesome. Good job. You just destroyed my vehicle. I got money coming in. See you, Mochisse. Search my things and me, are going away. Are you gonna pay your rent, Ashley? Are you gonna pay our half, your half? You're not gonna pay your half, are you? You're contractually obligated from this lease to pay your half of the rent. I talked to Jeff today, he's aware. It's not funny, Ashley. What you're doing right now is crazy. I don't think anybody would disagree with that. This is our property you're destroying. She's destroying our vehicle. You see that shit? See how crazy that is? I'm recording it all. And now I got your truck on video tape as an eyewitness. If you touch anything that's mine, I'm suing you. Yeah. It's so funny, it's so funny. Well you're crazy. 4Ks 4O A8C. Alright, well, I think we all know where this is going. Just probably gonna hurt me after this."
